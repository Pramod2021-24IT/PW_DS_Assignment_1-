    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, \n",

    "\n",

    "3. Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a blueprint for subclasses by specifying required methods.\n",
    "- Ensures that subclasses implement specific methods, providing a clear contract or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforcement: Ensures subclasses adhere to a specific structure.\n",
    "- Clarity: Defines a common interface, making code more predictable and maintainable.\n",

    "1. **Encapsulation**: Bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class), hiding internal details and exposing only necessary interfaces.\n",

    "2. **Access Modifiers**: Use public, private, and protected modifiers to control visibility and access to class members.\n",

    "3. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Define blueprints for classes (abstract classes) or method signatures (interfaces) without implementations, promoting consistency and flexibility.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Method Overriding and Overloading**: Modify inherited methods in subclasses (overriding) or define methods with the same name but different parameters (overloading) to enhance functionality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Design Patterns**: Implement patterns like Factory, Singleton, and Facade to manage object creation, ensure single instances, and simplify complex systems.\n"
